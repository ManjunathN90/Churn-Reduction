# Churn-Reduction
### Problem Statement:
Churn (loss of customers to competition) is a problem for companies because it is more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep your existing one from leaving. Customer retention or moving are based on the customer usage pattern/behavior. The objective of this project is to develop an algorithm to predict customer behavior whether customer will churn out or not depending on the customer usage pattern.
